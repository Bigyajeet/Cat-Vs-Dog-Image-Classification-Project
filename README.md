# Cat vs. Dog Image Classification Project

## Deep Learning Project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either a "cat" or a "dog." The model is trained on a large dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.

## Features

* **CNN Architecture:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for robust image feature extraction and classification.
* **Overfitting Reduction Techniques:** Incorporates several techniques to combat overfitting, including:
    * **MaxPooling:** Reduces the spatial dimensions of the output from convolutional layers, helping to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost.
    * **Dropout:** Randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training, which helps prevent co-adaptation of neurons.
    * **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the activations of the preceding layer at each batch, leading to faster and more stable training.
* **Data Handling:** Employs Python's generator concept for efficient processing of large image datasets, preventing memory issues.
* **Data Visualization:** Leverages the `matplotlib` library to plot training and validation metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) for better understanding of model performance.
* **Kaggle Integration:**
    * Dataset downloaded directly from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
    * Kaggle API credentials (e.g., `kaggle.json`) are securely handled and uploaded to Google Colab for seamless access to the dataset.
* **Google Colab Environment:** The entire project is developed and executed within Google Colaboratory, utilizing its free GPU resources for accelerated training.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains a large number of images of dogs and cats, split into training and validation sets.

## How to Run (on Google Colab)

1.  **Open the Notebook:** Open `cat_vs_dog_classification.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2.  **Upload Kaggle API Key:**
    * Go to your Kaggle profile and create an API token (this will download `kaggle.json`).
    * In your Colab notebook, upload the `kaggle.json` file to your Colab environment (e.g., using `files.upload()` from `google.colab`).
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary libraries are installed within the Colab environment. You might need to run:
    ```bash
    !pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy kaggle
    ```
4.  **Download Dataset:** The notebook will contain code to download the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset using your Kaggle API key.
5.  **Run All Cells:** Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially to train the model and see the results.

## Results

The project will output training and validation accuracy and loss graphs, demonstrating the model's performance over epochs. The trained model will be capable of classifying unseen cat and dog images with a good level of accuracy.
